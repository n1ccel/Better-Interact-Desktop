A small mod for the game ChilloutVR for PC (desktop) users.
1. Allows you to tilt your head to the left or right (LeftCTRL + MouseWheel)
2. Frees his hands and stretches them forward (Q - left hand, E - right hand)
3. Replaces the red square dot with a round translucent one (looks much better than the standard one, but adheres to the general interface style)
4. Allows you to disable the dot (Left CTRL+R) (original mod: https://github.com/SDraw/ml_mods_cvr/tree/master/ml_drs )
5. Most important: allows you to switch gestures using the mouse wheel (LeftShift + MouseWheel - for the left hand, F + MouseWheel - for the right hand)
